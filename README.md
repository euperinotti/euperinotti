# Welcome to my profile

I am a teenager who loves computers and started programming in 2019.

Since my childhood I'm in love computers and tecnlogy. So I was always interacting with them in someway, most part of the time that intereaction was related with design sotfwares and games.

At the age of 15, I started studying programming at high school. Now I'm studying software engineering in college.

I intend to work with web development, more especifically back-end, in the future, so now I am improving the skills that I already have and developing some new more.
