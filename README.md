# Hi, my name is Perinotti
I am a 19 years old boy who loves computers and started programming since 2019.
I intend to work with back-end in the future, so I am trying to improve the skills that I have and develop some new more.

# Coding
I have some experiences with HTML, CSS, Java Script, PHP and MySQL
